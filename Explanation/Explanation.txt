The problem was approched through the following steps:

1. Separate the noun phrases from each sentence and store them as objects in a list.
2. The rest of the sentence is stored as relations.
3. Relations are divided into two types : identity and other.
4. Identity relations are defined as: 'is a','is an','is identical to/with','is equal to/with'.
5. All others are other relations.
6. Build a weighted directed graph.
   a) Assign nodes to all objects.
   b) Assign weights to all relations. For other relations assign weights serially from 1. For identity relations assign weights serially from 100.
   c) Assign direction to each branch.
   
7. CASE 1: [ object1, other_relation1, object2
             object3, other_relation1, object4
             object3, identity_relation1, object1
             this implies: object4, identity_relation1, object2]
            
8. CASE 2: [ object1, other_relation1, object2
             object3, identity_relation1, object1
             object4, identity_relation1, object2
             this implies: object3, other_relation1, object4]
             
9. CASE 3: [ object1, other_relation1, object2
             object3, other_relation1, object2
             this implies: object3, identity_relation1, object1]
             
10. CASE 4: [ object1, other_relation1, object2
              object3, identity_relation1, object1
              this implies: object3, other_relation1, object2]
              
11. Apply all cases on all object nodes.
              
12. Print all relations including given and inferred to get the complete knowledge graph.
